                <h3>Dragon Ball Legacy of Goku Series</h3>

                <p>
                    This 2D action RPG series on the Game Boy Advanced is known and loved by many in the Dragon Ball 
                    community. All three games in the series follow the adventures of Goku and his friends through 
                    all the arcs of Dragon Ball Z. <br><br>
                    What makes this series stand out is it's ability to tell the Dragon Balll story in an immersive and 
                    fun way, with many fans believing that it does it better than more modern games like Dragon Ball 
                    Z: Kakarot, despite the old but cute graphics. Buu's Fury went above and beyond compared to its 
                    predecessors by including new features such as a money/shop system, an improvement to the over world 
                    map, an increase in quantity and details of explorable areas, a character customization system, 
                    the inclusion of fusion characters, and many more.<br><br>
                    Because of its engaging and smooth gameplay as well as the good story telling, Dragon Ball 
                    Legacy of Goku earns a spot on this list.

                    Dragon Ball FighterZ is a 3v3 Street Fighters style game. With it's wide selection of
                    characters, as well as it's interesting combo system, Dragon Ball fans are sure to have 
                    a lot of fun with this game both casually and competitively.<br><br>
                    What made this game stand out the most is that it broke the stereotype of Dragon Ball 
                    games only being for casual play and showed potential of becoming a competitve game 
                    which it did. This wonderful game brought both old and new fans of the franchise together. 
                    Despite being released in 2018, it still shows signs of a game that is not close 
                    to dying, as fans from all over the globe still play this game both casually 
                    and competitively.<br><br>
                    Because of it's difference in genre and how it introduced Dragon Ball games to the competitive 
                    scene, Dragon Ball FighterZ earned it's spot on this list.

                    Last but cetainly not least we have the Budokai Tenkaichi Series. Known by even non-Dragon Ball fans, 
                    this series has been the one representing Dragon Ball games for many years now. It features fast 
                    paced and satisfying combat that give players the sensation that they are in the anime. 
                    Each game in this series has a massive selection of characters which mostly play different 
                    from each other. Players are bound to find a character they like and have fun with.<br><br>
                    With the recent addition to the series by the name of Dragon Ball Sparking! ZERO, fans of this game 
                    series have come back together more numerous and motivated than ever. This new game stays loyal to the 
                    classic Tenkaichi playstyle and implemented some magnificent new graphics that have Dragon Ball fans all 
                    over the world leaping with joy.<br><br>
                    Being the most popular and fun video game series in Dragon Ball history, this series is more than worthy 
                    to earn a spot on this list.
