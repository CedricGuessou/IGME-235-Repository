    <h1>IGME-235 Project 2 Documentation</h1>
    <h2>Goal</h2>
    <p>
        My plan is to use the Pokemon API to make a website that searches 
        for Pokemon based on types selected by the user and also provides a sample move set for it to use.
        The target audience for this project is casual players who just want to have a solid move set for their Pokemon. 
        If I end up having enough time, I will improve my algorithm to select the moves based on the specific game.
    </p>

    <h2>Notes Part 1</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            I will be assuming that the Pokemon is being used in a 1v1 format (so as to avoid more complicated logic).
        </li>
        <li>
            The move set type will be determined by the chosen Pokemon's stats. For example:
            If the Pokemon has Attack and Special Attack as its highest stats an offensive move set will be created.
        </li>
        <li>
            Use the stats property to campare and see what type of moveset this Pokemon should use
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Moveset Types</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Main Damage Dealers (Offensive): </b>Chosen if attack or special attack is the dominant stat. 
            They have two offensive moves that match their typing, one move to counter
            types they are weak to and another move for stat buffs
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Basic Sketch</h2>

    <h2>Peer Feedback Suggestions</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            G-max Pokemon return errors because they have no moves stored in the API. 
            Pokemon with single moves like Ditto as well. Find a way to prevent that. (Done)
        </li>
        <li>
            Make the background color change based on the selected type. When two types are selected make it half 
            and half (unlikely to implement due to having to change a lot of stuff in CSS) (Not done).
        </li>
        <li>
            Make everything bigger. (Done)
        </li>
        <li>
        Add a way to limit the number of Pokemon displayed (Done)
        </li>
        <li>
            Change the background based on the Pokemon type selected (Not done)
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Notes Part 2</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            The objective of the website was changed from "Displaying optimal Pokemon movesets" to "Displaying random movesets". 
            Reason being that I wasn't able to figure out logic to get data from the Pokemon's moves without having the website 
            running really slowly.
        </li>
        <li>
            Generate button won't work if Type 1 is not selected.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How it works</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            When the generate button is pressed, it retrieves the value of the two type selection boxes. Using that value, 
            an API call is made to access that type section of the Pokemon API.
        </li>
        <li>
            After accessing the section of the API reserved for the first type, we access the pokemon property  
            to get the URLs of all the Pokemon of that type. We then run another API call to access each 
            one of those Pokemon's information and add references in the form of a list.
        </li>
        <li>
            If a second type was selected, we go through every Pokemon in the list and check if they contain the second type. If 
            a Pokemon is of both types it is added to a new list that will be used to display the final information.
        </li>
        <li>
            After the final Pokemon are added in, a method is run to randomly select 4 moves from their move pools (There is code 
            to handle Pokemon with less than 4 moves). We then format each Pokemon output in a grid square manner and 
            add it to our HTML.
        </li>
    </ul>
