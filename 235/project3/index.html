    <h1>Dungeon Survivor</h1>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <p>Your objective is to survive as long as possible while killing zombies(the gray blocks) 
        to gain a higher score. You take damage when the zombies touch you, thankfully they 
        will only attack you is you're within a certain distance. 
        Make sure to keep an eye on your life, because one it reaches 0% it's game over.
    </p>
